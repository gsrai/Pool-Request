TODO

can they all extend admin?

make a mirage branch and a firebase branch?

make rules similar to admin? switch games rules be at front
make header a component

player two should be the challenger of player one.

Can action be extracted out of admin and put into {{yeild}}?
|each el|
{{yield (action "setSection" (el.id))}}
|/each|

make init run every time, not just first load.
